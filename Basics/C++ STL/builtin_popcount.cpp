/*

Key Characteristics of __builtin_popcount()
Bit Count: It counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer.

Efficient Implementation: The function is highly optimized and uses processor-specific instructions to perform the count efficiently.

Compiler Specific: It is a GCC-specific built-in function, though similar functions are available in other compilers with different names, such as __popcnt in MSVC.

/*
Summary

Function: __builtin_popcount(x)

Purpose: Counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of x.

Time Complexity: O(1)

Compiler Specific: GCC, Clang (also available in other compilers with similar functionality).
__builtin_popcount() is a powerful tool for bit manipulation and is particularly useful in performance-critical applications where counting bits quickly is essential.
