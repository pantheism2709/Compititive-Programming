# Performance Considerations in Competitive Programming

In competitive programming, as well as on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, our code typically runs on online servers. Understanding the performance constraints of these servers is crucial for writing efficient code.

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Operation Limits**:
   - Most online servers can execute approximately \(10^8\) operations in about 1 second.

2. **Time Limits**:
   - We must be careful that if the time limit is given as 2s the operations in our code must be roughly 2*108, not 1016. Similarly, 5s refers to 5*108

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - To ensure that your code runs within the given time limits, aim for a time complexity around O(10^8) when the time limit is 1 second. Constants and lower-order terms are generally ignored in this context.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can improve the likelihood that your solution will run efficiently within the provided time constraints.
