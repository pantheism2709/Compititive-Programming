# Performance Considerations in Competitive Programming

In competitive programming, as well as on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, our code typically runs on online servers. Understanding the performance constraints of these servers is crucial for writing efficient code.

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Operation Limits**:
   - Most online servers can execute approximately \(10^8\) operations in about 1 second.

2. **Time Limits**:
   - If the time limit for a problem is given as 2 seconds, your code should be optimized to handle around \(2 \times 10^8\) operations, not \(10^{16}\) operations.
   - Similarly, if the time limit is 5 seconds, your code should ideally handle up to \(5 \times 10^8\) operations.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - To ensure that your code runs within the given time limits, aim for a time complexity around \(O(10^8)\) when the time limit is 1 second. Constants and lower-order terms are generally ignored in this context.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can improve the likelihood that your solution will run efficiently within the provided time constraints.
